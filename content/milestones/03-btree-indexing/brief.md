# Milestone 3: B-Tree Indexing

## Overview

Add a B-tree index to your storage engine so lookups don't require scanning the entire dataset. You'll implement a disk-backed B-tree that maps keys to file offsets, turning O(n) lookups into O(log n).

## Learning Objectives

- B-tree data structure and disk-friendly node layout
- Page-based I/O and buffer management
- Index maintenance during inserts and deletes
