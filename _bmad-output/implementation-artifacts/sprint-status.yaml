# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog -> in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress -> done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)
#
# CONTENT AUTHORING DEPENDENCY (parallel workstream):
# ===================================================
# Content authoring (milestone briefs, starter code, acceptance criteria, benchmark
# workloads, reference implementations, concept explainer SVGs) is NOT tracked in
# these engineering epics. It is a separate curriculum workstream that must proceed
# in parallel with implementation.
#
# Deadlines by epic dependency:
#   - Epics 1-3: Can use stub/fixture content (hardcoded test milestones, dummy Go programs)
#   - BEFORE Epic 4: Milestone 1 content REQUIRED (brief, starter code, structured
#     acceptance criteria assertions, reference implementation)
#   - BEFORE Epic 7: Benchmark workloads + pinned reference implementation REQUIRED
#   - BEFORE Epic 9: Milestone 1 content must be polished for public preview
#
# Recommended start: Begin Milestone 1 content authoring alongside Epic 2.
# Content location: content/milestones/ (NOT a pnpm workspace — no package.json, no TS)
# Validation: Content CI pipeline (Story 1.6 scaffold) validates structure + compilation
